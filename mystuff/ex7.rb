puts "Mary had a little lamb." # prints Mary had a little lamb
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}." # prints Its fleece was white as snow. the reason why it did not show the error was becasue #{'snow'} is not reffering to a variable. If it was like #{snow} then it will display an error.
puts "And everywhere that Mary went." # prints And everywhere that Mary went.
puts "." * 10  # what'd that do? # this is quite neet I didnt knew you can do this but it is simply multiplying the string "." ten times so it will print ..........

end1 = "C" # all of them are a variable with string value
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6 # now we are adding all string to one. note its has print rather than puts print will not add a newline after executing. it will print CheeseBurger.
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

#Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
#Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
#From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
#When you go to the next exercise, look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
#Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
